Analysis of automatic vs manual cars

The following document uses the `mtcars` data set in order to study the effect of transmission type of the car  
with the mpg of the car. This analysis also tries to find out the effect of other variables over mpg performance  
of the car. The data set is available in the R data sets. After analyzing we conclude that, the manual cars  
give better mpg than the automatic cars.  
The mpg of the manual cars is more by 7.244 units than the automatic cars.   Thus manual cars can be said
to be more efficient.
